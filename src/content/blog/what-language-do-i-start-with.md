# What language do I start with? (personal opinion)

## How can we choose our first languages? ðŸ¤”

We have to take 5 main standards into account:

- [How easy it's](#how-easy)
- [The big of their communities](#communities)
- [The amount of free resources](#resources)
- [The easy you can run the code (Their IDEs are easy)](#IDE)
- [The most in-demand](#in-demand)

## How Easy It Is

The starting language for you has to be easy or you might hate programming from the beginning, so you don't have to start with something like **C++** or **Java**, it's not about how "cool" that language is, it's about how much you understand it and comfortable with it.

```py
print("Easy")
```

```js
console.log("Fast");
```

```ruby
puts "and";
```

```php
<?php
echo "smooth";
```

Start with easy programming languages like **Python**, **JavaScript**, **Ruby**, **PHP**.

> The most important thing that you don't think that programming itself is easy, that may cause you to stop and get bored.

## The big of their communities <a name="communities"></a>

Starting with a language that has a big community will make starting with it much easier.

**You can start with something easy like PHP, Ruby, etc... But why do we start with Python & JavaScript?**  
because they have a really big community that can help you whenever you're stuck. And you need that help while starting. BUT you can start with others too.

### The Amount Of Free Resources

When you start learning to program the resources is the most important thing to think about, some languages don't have easy-to-get resources.

Some useful resources for beginners can be: [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), [SoloLearn](http://sololearn.com/), [StackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/)

Resources are very important _especially if you're self-learning_.

**So find a programming language that has a lot of resources**

###### Pro-Tip: Reading the docs is very useful to understand any language, you'll find most of them in [devdocs.io](https://devdocs.io/).

## The easy you can run the code (Their IDEs are easy) <a name="IDE"></a>

**Running**, **debugging** and **testing** is so important for any programmer\developer and you have to learn it, but if it isn't easy that'll take so much time of you just trying to run it while you can use other languages like **Python** or such and run it easily and that'll make you well progress in lesser time.

![Best IDEs](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5tin5pv53v2sfz9jmzir.png)

You can use [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) since it can run lots of languages and they're easy to use.

## The most in-demand <a name="in-demand"></a>

The best language to start with is the one that you can work with once you finish learning it, or at least you have more years of experience since you started earlier, which indeed will increase your chance of finding a job.
So you have to choose a language you might start with after learning it, so you have to know what do most companies search for.

### The Most In-Demand Programming Languages in 2021

[![The Most In-Demand Programming Languages in 2021](https://cdn.ucberkeleybootcamp.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/106/2020/12/most-demand-programming-languages-2021-1017x1024.jpg)](https://bootcamp.berkeley.edu/blog/most-in-demand-programming-languages/)

This list is only for 2021, if you are reading this in like 2024, 2025, etc... The in-demand languages will be changed probably, so you have to [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=most-in-demand-programming-languages&rlz=1C1CHBD_arEG952EG952&oq=most-in-demand-programming-languages&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60.666j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) it yourself.

## Recommendations

You're not required to follow all the standards of this post, there are more important ones, so you have to just measure them, don't take it for granted. Good luck.

### Keep in mind:

- Keep in mind that depending on the field you'll work in, you have to choose your first language since some languages are better in fields that others aren't; such as _JavaScript_ or _PHP_ to **web development**, _C#_ or _C++_ to **game development**, _Python_ to **AI & Machine Learning** etc...
- Do not be intolerant of the language you will start with or force others to start with it as well.
- Don't stop learning, and don't reject learning a new language for no reason.
- When you learn your first language; focus more on learning the basics of programming itself, not just learning the language.
